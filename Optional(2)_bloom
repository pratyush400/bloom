    """increasing the bits reduces false positives exponentially for fixed number of indices and number of inserted items.
    Increasing indices initially reduces false positives but stops after the optimal point. Which can be calculated as k(optimal)=(m/n)ln2.
    two 32-bit: bits = 2^32 = 4,294,966,296.(splitting 64 bit hash in half).
    three 20-bit: bits = 2^20 =1,048,576.   
    While the two 32-bit takes up more memory it also can store more items.
    The three 20-bits take up less memory, but has an increased chance of a false positive with large n.
    A good tradeoff just depends on if you need a small chance of a false positive or something to use limited memory.
    A rule of thumb is that bites needs to be proportional to number of element."""
